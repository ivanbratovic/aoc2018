# Advent of Code 2018

Advent of Code 2018 repository for all puzzles.

Will use any programming language I feel like, so beware.
Each puzzle description will start with the programming language used, at least that's the plan.
Writing this before AoC starts, I predict I'll use C++, Python, Java and R most often.

# Puzzle 1
*Programming language used:* C++

*Puzzle description:* This first one is rather simple, and boils down into a parsing problem.
You are given a list of numbers, prefixed by a unary operator, either a `+` or a `-`. The puzzle was split into two parts:

1. The first part was to find the sum of all the numbers (or the 'frequency') in the input list.
2. The second part was a little bit more complicated, as it involved looping the input list, and adding and
and subtracting the numbers (just like in the 1st part) but keep doing so until a given partial sum was reached
twice.
